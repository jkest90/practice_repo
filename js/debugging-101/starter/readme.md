Debugging exercise

Debug the following application.

The home page allows the user to log bugs, each of which has:
- a name
- a file
- a line number
- an avatar (URL to an image)
- an "is fixed" boolean flag
- a list of messages

A list of the bugs that have been logged is followed by a form in which the user can add new bugs.

The user may click on the name of any bug in the list to get the detailed information on that bug.
From the bug detail page, the user can click on the Back button to return to the bug list home page.
