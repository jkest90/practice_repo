Debugging exercise

Debug the following application.  Start it by running 'npm run start'.  This will clean the database and start with no data.

The home page allows the user to log bugs, each of which has:
- a name
- a file
- a line number
- a list of messages

A list of the bugs that have been logged is followed by a form in which the user can add new bugs.
The user must click on "Add Message" to open a text field in which to add a text message to the bug.
The user may click on Submit to log the bug data entered and add it to the list.

The user may click on the name of any bug in the list to get the detailed information on that bug.
From the bug detail page, the user can click on the Back button to return to the bug list home page.
